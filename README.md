# Netflix Clone

Welcome to the Netflix Clone project! This project is a web application built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. It mimics the UI and functionality of Netflix, allowing users to browse movies and TV shows, view details, and watch trailers.

Check out the live demo: [Netflix Clone Live Demo](https://netflixclone-myut.onrender.com/)

## Features

- **Browse Movies and TV Shows:** Explore a collection of popular movies and TV shows.
- **View Details:** Click on a movie or TV show to see more information, such as synopsis, release date, and rating.
- **Watch Trailers:** Watch trailers of selected movies and TV shows directly on the website.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling web applications.
- **React Router:** Used for client-side routing within the React application.
- **axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
